**CrossDrop** is a partial implementation of [Google's Quick Share](https://blog.google/products/android/how-to-use-quick-share-android/) in Flutter for macOS, iOS and Linux.

CrossDrop is based on [NearDrop](https://github.com/grishka/NearDrop), a Swift implementation of Nearby Share for macOS.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **‚ö†Ô∏è This is a work in progress. It is not yet feature-complete, and it is not yet stable. It is not yet ready for use.**

> [!NOTE]
> As far as I find time I am working on the first version for testing. The current status can be seen in the [dev branch](https://github.com/Medformatik/CrossDrop/tree/dev). At the moment I cannot estimate how long I will need until the first release.

[Protocol documentation](https://github.com/grishka/NearDrop/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) is available in the NearDrop repository.

The app lives in your menu bar and saves files to your downloads folder.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Getting CrossDrop to work on iOS has the least priority, first getting it to work on Linux is the goal. 

üìà Since this project has gotten more attention, I will try very hard to release a working version as soon as possible. While much of the UI is ready so far, I'm currently working on the Quick Share feature itself. After that, I still need to implement notifications.

## Limitations

* **Receive only**. For now. I haven't yet figured out how to make Android turn on the MDNS service and/or show the "a device nearby is sharing" notification.
* **Wi-Fi LAN only**. Your Android device and your Mac need to be on the same network for this app to work. Google's implementation supports multiple mediums, including Wi-Fi Direct, Wi-Fi hotspot, Bluetooth, some kind of 5G peer-to-peer connection, and even a WebRTC-based protocol that goes over the internet through Google servers. Wi-Fi direct isn't supported on macOS (Apple has their own, incompatible, AWDL thing, used in AirDrop). Bluetooth needs further reverse engineering.
* **Visible to everyone on your network at all times** while the app is running. Limited visibility (contacts etc) requires talking to Google servers, and becoming temporarily visible requires listening for whatever triggers the "device nearby is sharing" notification.

## FAQ

### Why does this exist next to NearDrop?

NearDrop is a Swift implementation of Nearby Share for macOS. It therefore only works on macOS. CrossDrop is a Flutter implementation of Nearby Share. It serves the same purpose, but works on more platforms. This way, Nearby Share can also be used on Linux and iOS.

### Why not the other way around, i.e. AirDrop on Android?

While I am an Android developer, and I have looked into this, this is nigh-impossible. AirDrop uses [AWDL](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19587701/what-is-awdl-apple-wireless-direct-link-and-how-does-it-work), Apple's own proprietary take on peer-to-peer Wi-Fi. This works on top of 802.11 itself, the low-level Wi-Fi protocol, and thus can not be implemented without messing around with the Wi-Fi adapter drivers and raw packets and all that. It might be possible on Android, but it would at the very least require root and possibly a custom kernel. There is [an open-source implementation of AWDL and AirDrop for Linux](https://owlink.org/code/).
